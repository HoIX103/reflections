When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    For example, when I want to write a game with my friends, using remote repository
    make me easiler to collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There maybe some cases that other people have made changes that I don't want or I'd like to add the changes later, so it may causes
    problem if Git automatically stay-to-date with my remote repository.
 
 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of a respository in GitHub. We use it when we would like to edit the file from other GitHub user without changing the original project.
    A clone is a copy of a respository from GitHub to my own machine. We
    use it when we want to edit the file on our own machine.
    Branch is a independent line of commit. We use it when we want to 
    add some new features but we don't want the unfinished work affect
    the original project. We can merge the branch to the master when
    the new features is finished.
