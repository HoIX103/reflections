When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    For example, when I want to write a game with my friends, using remote repository
    make me easiler to collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There maybe some cases that other people have made changes that I don't want or I'd like to add the changes later, so it may causes
    problem if Git automatically stay-to-date with my remote repository.
